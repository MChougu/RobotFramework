Install python 3.8
cmd Python -V
It is recommended that you install the root certificates 
from the C:\Windows\System32\ALL.ROOTS.PEM.crt file into the 
following Python .pem file assuming you installed Python in the C:\Python\PythonXX directory: 

C:\Python\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages\pip\_vendor\certifi​\cacert.pem 

install pip
access PIP through a CMD window

pip install robotframework
   pip install robotframework --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.org

If security has allowed access to those hosts the package should install, 
but you should revisit the SSL certificates section and make sure they are 
in the PEM files listed so you don’t have to continue doing this.
